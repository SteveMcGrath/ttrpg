## Bio

This lone Scurillian has seen a lot of action. As a young crustacean, he was
enchanted by the Sea Hags to fight against the Krakens in the battle of
Devil's Cross. A Kraken Archmage was able to break the enchantment long enough
for some of the creatures enlisted to the Sea Hags to escape. His stubborn will
helped him fight his way out. Shakas was lucky to live through the battle but
was extremely scarred. Ugly even by Scurillian standards. From then on Shakas
seemed to find himself in the middle of each major conflict, each time narrowly
escaping and learning from the experience. His uncanny luck seems to run both
ways. He has spent his time collecting barnacles and riches as he has made his
way from boat to boat as a hired tactician and ruthless marine.

## Edges & Advances

-   **Keen Mind**: +2 Common Knowledge
-   **Shell**: +3 Toughness
-   **Telescopic Eyes**: +2 Notice
-   **Pincers**: STR+d6
-   **Luck**: +1 Bennies
-   **Rich**: 3x Money
-   **Martial Artist**: Striking +1, Claws +1 die type
-   **Martial Warrior**: Striking +1, Claws +1 die type
-   **MacGuyver**: Creates improvised devices from scraps
    > A McGyver can improvise a device from common resources when the need
    > arises. Given a few simple items, he can make a Repair roll to craft
    > improvised weapons, explosives, or tools, that last until used or the
    > end of the encounter (GM’s call). This takes one entire turn, and he
    > can’t move or take any other actions while constructing the device.  
    > Failure means the device isn’t ready. A Critical Failure means he doesn’t
    > have the right materials and can’t create the device this encounter.
    > Success creates a minor explosive (2d4 explosive in a Small Blast Template),
    > a one-shot projectile weapon like a “zip gun” (Range 5/10/20, Damage 2d6),
    > rickety raft, electrical source, etc. A raise creates a larger explosive
    > (2d6 in a Medium Blast Template or 2d4 in a Large), a better ranged weapon
    > (five shots, 2d8 damage, Range 10/20/40), a more stable raft, a more
    > powerful battery, etc. The quality or power of the creation is up to the
    > Game Master, but creativity should be rewarded, particularly in
    > the most dire and dramatic situations.
-   **Mr. Fixit**: Repair +2 & Takes 1/2 time, 1/4 time with a raise
-   **Chi**: Once per combat, reroll failed attack, make enemy reroll successful
    attack, or add +d6 to unarmed Fighting attack.
-   **Sweep**:
    > Sweep allows a character to make a single Fighting attack and apply it
    > against all targets in his Reach at a −2 penalty (friends and foes alike).
    > Resolve damage separately for each enemy that’s hit. A fighter may only
    > perform a Sweep once per turn. It may not be combined with Frenzy.
-   **Improved Sweep**:
    > As above but the whirlwind of death may ignore the −2 penalty.
-   **Counter-Attack**:
    > Fighters with this Edge deal instant punishment for an enemy’s mistakes.
    > Once per round (if not Shaken or Stunned), the character receives a Free
    > Attack (page 101) against one failed Fighting attack against him. The
    > counterattack takes place immediately (before other hits against the hero
    > on the same Action Card, if any).
-   **First Strike**:
    > Once per round, as long as he’s not Shaken or Stunned, the hero gets a
    > free Fighting attack against a foe immediately after he moves into Reach.
    > (See Free Attacks on page 101).
-   **Hero**:
    > Heroes can pull off stunts lesser men can only dream of. Once per session,
    > when you spend a benny, you may add the reroll total to your previous roll.
-   **Weapon Master**
    > The warrior increases his Parry by +1 and the bonus damage die for Fighting
    > rolls is a d8 instead of a d6 (see Bonus Damage, page 94). He must be armed
    > to gain these benefits, but this includes the Martial Artist Edge, claws,
    > or other abilities that count as weapons.
