# The Arena

For arena battles the Under Dog decides the BV for the competition. The opponents(s) then will try to come as close
to the target BV as possible. There should be no more than plus or minus 10%. If the BV values need to be brought
closer together the players can adjust their Gunnery or Piloting skill to adjust the BV. (Use BV table from rule
package). This pilot skill adjustment is only for the arena game and will NOT be permanent. It represents the techs
at the arena modifying the performance of the mech.

## Arena Combat Rules

1. Head shots are strictly forbidden. If a player gets a head location result, they must reroll the hit location
   dice. The second result is permanent. If a head shot comes up again then the player who committed the rule
   violation is penalized half of their final “crowd goes wild” total. If the head shot results in a mech/pilot
   kill the player is instead disqualified and removed from the battle immediately. They do not get a pay day
   for this battle.
2. Prone Mechs cannot be fired upon or engaged in close combat.
3. Mechs with unconscious pilots cannot be fired upon or engaged in close combat.
4. A mech may withdraw at the beginning of any turn.

## The Crowd Goes Wild

Since the Arena is all about ratings and advertising the players, payout is based on how much they effected the
ratings. The payout is calculated using the below table.

| Action                                     | Rating |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----: |
| Each successful ranged hit on a Mech       |   +1   |
| Each successful **Critical** hit on a Mech |  +d6   |
| Each successful punch or kick              |   +2   |
| Each Mech body section destroyed           |   +3   |
| Each successful **Death from Above**       |  d6+3  |

During the match each player keeps a running total of their rating result. At the end of the match the surviving
player with the highest rating is the winner. The winner adds **d6** to their rating result total. The payout is
calculated by multiplying the players rating result by 80. All Surviving players get a payout

## Mech Insurance

Arena battles are run by the inner-sphere crime families. They are willing to underwrite an insurance contract for
mechs which fight in the arena. They charge 10% of the BV value of the mech. The insurance contract is only for
one match. It is void if the pilot dies. Coverage is 100% of repair/replace cost.
