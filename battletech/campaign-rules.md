## Mech Repair & Re-Arm Costs

| Damaged Component                       | BV Cost |
|:----------------------------------------|:-------:|
| Armor                                   | 3       |
| Internal Structure                      | 6       |
| Internal Structure (location destroyed) | 10      |
| Engines, Gyros, Sensors, Life Support   | 15      |

## Lance Up-Keep

In order to simplify covering the various costs in maintaining a Mech lance (pilot expenses, ammo, general maintinence, etc.)
up-keep is simply the x10 the lance's battle rating.  If up-keep isn't paid before the scenario begins, then every time a
battle roll is performed during the scenario, and that roll involves a weapon that consumes ammunition, then roll a d6 to
determine if the weapon has run out of ammunition.  On a 5+, the weapon has run dry and can no longer fire.  Further all
Pilot Skill Rolls will be at -1 for the duration of scenario.

## Scenario Payment Schedule

* **Base Pay**: 65x Battle Rating
* **Winnings**: Determined per scenario
* **Per Mech Killed**: 2x Tonnage

## Pilot Experience

Note that unless specified, all of the counters are cumulative and are not reset between scenarios.

| Event                                                      | Exp. Awarded | 
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:------------:|
| Scenario participation                                     | 1            |
| Each internal location of enemy mech destroyed             | 1            |
| Each Fire Phase you cause internal damage to an enemy Mech | 1            |

| Every **successful** Shutdown Roll                         | 1            |

| Every 4th **successful** Indirect Fire attack (spotter)    | 1            |

### Underdogs

Before the scenario begins, the opponents compare Battle Ratings, and the opponent with the lower rating is the underdog.
Each underdog player receives 1 experience immediately that can be assigned to the pilot of their choice.  Underdog players
may receive additional benefits based on the difference between the opposing forces.  To determine this difference, take
the Battle Ratings of the opposing forces and follow the table and formula below:

```
 Opposition Battle Rating / Underdog Battle Rating
```

| Difference      | Additional Awards                                            |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than 1.20  | No additional awards                                         |
| Less than 1.65  | 1 Exp. per surviving pilot and an additional 100 BV warchest |
| 1.65 or Greater | 2 Exp. per surviving pilot and an additional 200 BV warchest |

## Post Battle Checks

### Wounded Pilot

In order to determine the fate of any pilot that has been wounded during the course of the scenario, roll 2d6 and refer
to the table below for the outcome:

| Roll | Result         |
|:----:|:---------------|
| 2    | New Skill      |
| 3-4  | Negative Quirk |
| 5-11 | No effect      |
| 12   | 1 Exp.         |

If a **New Skill** is assigned, then roll a d6 to determine the award:

| Roll | Result            |
|:----:|:------------------|
| 1-2  | -1 Gunnery Skill  |
| 3-5  | -1 Pilot Skill    |
| 6    | 1 Exp.            |

### Pilot Skill Adjustment and Quirks

When adjusting a Pilot's abilities, only one action can be performed for each pilot.  This means if a Quirk is assigned
to the pilot are part of a **Wounded Pilot** check or other assignment, then this pilot is precluded from any of the
actions available here.

| Action            | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th |
|:------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| -1 Gunnery Skill  |  8  | 10  | 12  | 14  |
| -1 Piloting Skill |  4  |  6  |  8  | 10  |
| New Special Skill | Cost as indicated for skill

The maximum number of special skills for each skill type are determined based on the skill level for the Pilot.  For each
skill type, check the table below to understand how many special skills may be assigned to the Pilot.  Further when
selecting a special skill for a Pilot, each **Lance** may have only **2** of the same skill, with special exception to
_[Floats Like a Butterfly](#butterfly)_, in which only **1** is allowed for each lance.

| Skill Type Level | Maximum Number of Special Skills |
|:----------------:|:---------------------------------|
|      4+          |   1                              |
|      3           |   2                              |
|      2           |   3                              |
|      1           |   4                              |
|      0           |   5                              |

## Selling Mechs, Weapons, Armor, or Internals

In order to sell any Mechs, the Mech must be in an undamaged condition (fully repaired).  Also when selling any equipment
to the merchants, all sales are final.  To determine the sale price of any equipment, roll 2d6 and refer to the table
below to determine the sale price of the equipment.  Clan players (only when selling clan-only equipment) will get the
best of 3 rolls when determining price.

| Roll | Result                              |
|:----:|:------------------------------------|
| 2    | 50% BV (get rid of it at any price) |
| 3-5  | 75% BV (at least it's something)    |
| 6-10 | 100% BV (seems reasonable)          |
| 11   | 125% BV (drive a hard bargain)      |
| 12   | 150% BV (found a sucker)            |

## Purchasing Mecs, Weapons, or Internals

Merchants throughout the Inner Sphere might have the equipment you happen to be looking for, depending on the parts.
In order to determine if the merchant has the part you desire, roll a d6 to determine if the merchant carries the
item your looking for (yes, that means the player rolls for each item).  A Player can increase the chance of aquiring
an item they especially desire by greasing a few palms and paying an additional 25% above market value to decrease the
rarity by one step.

Weapons and components may be swapped within an existing Mech as long as the item is of the same type and fits within
the existing space on the Mech.  For example, Pulse Lasers may be replaced with other Direct Energy (DE) weapons, or
Auto-Cannons could be replaced with another Direct Ballistic (DB) weapon of similar size.

All purchases must be declared before rolling.  The Player must have the necessary funds to purchase the item before
attempting to purchase, and a Player may only attempt to roll once for each item per scenario session.

| Result | Availability |
|:------:|:-------------|
|   1+   | Very Common  |
|   2+   | Common       |
|   3+   | Uncommon     |
|   4+   | Rare         |
|   5+   | Very Rare    |
|   6+   | Unique       |

* _**Success**_: Target must move towards the Pilot using the unit's fastest Movement Type
                 and the most direct route, and may only attack the Pilot.  This effect
                 ends after a number of turns equal to the Pilot's MoS, if Pilot moves
                 greater than 10 hexes away, or if another unit damages target.

* _**Failed**_: no effect.

  against it's target at any point before the target moves.  The target has no
  movement modifiers but is not Immobile.  Damage takes effect **immediately**.

  attacks against the unit apply.

### Demoralizer _(Cost 2)_

Instead of a weapons attack, select 1 target in line os sight and within 10 hexes.

  move closer to this unit, and suffers an additional +1 **To Hit Modifier** on all
  attacks against this unit.
