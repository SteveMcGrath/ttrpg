## Scintilating Medalion<a id="amulet-of-verility" />

* A small brass disc about an inch thick, the medallion is hollow 
  and contains a physical manifestation of Skeethen's soul. When 
  shaken, this physical object rattles inside it, Upon sealing himself 
  and the Tome of Banishment within the Sanctuary, the dying Windling Mage 
  placed his life force within the medallion in order to protect the Tome 
  and its eventual rescuer from the powers of the Horror that had marked 
  the would-be hero.
  
  When the would-be hero puts on the medallion(or Spirit Talks with Skeethen),
  crackling purple lightning surrounds the character as Skeethen's dormant soul 
  awakens. From the moment the eerie display ceases until a year and a day later,
  the character can resist the following Horror powers:

  Corrupt Karma, Karma Tap, Terror, and Thought Worm

  When a Horror uses any of these powers against the wearer, the character adds 
  +5 to his Spell/Mystic Defense or Social Defense, as appropriate.

  The medallion offers similar protection against any spells intended to dominate 
  the wearer's mind or control his actions.

  After a year and a day, Skeethen's spirit escapes and the medallion becomes no 
  more than a pretty piece of jewelry. The presence of Skeethen's life force within 
  the medalion means that the wearer need not spend Legend Points or weave a thread 
  to the medallion's true pattern in order to use it.

# Notes

## 11/18/24

Left for Bloodwood (20 days each way).  A'Mon picked up a horse that is barely able to hold him
and the rest of the party picked up several goats to help carry the load of our supplies
and set out.  After several days of travel we ran into a group of 3 low-level adepts that
had run up a tree after suffering many wounds and were pinned up in that tree by a couple
of dogs.  After we had chased the dogs off, the adepts came down the tree and let us know
about the "Grim Legion" and how they had overrun the nearest town (Honto).

Abakoola -- Leader

After starting to setup camp for the night near where the we had chesed the dogs away, a
few of us started to hear some whimptering in the nearby woods.  Upon investigation, we
discovered a tiny puppy that was crying out.  Titus initially tried to feed the pup some
meat sticks, but the puppy rejected the meat and instead appeared to be looking for some
milk.  They then looked through the small heard of goats and discovered that one of the
goats had recently given birth before we had bought them.  Yeet milked the goat,
gave the milk to Titus to give to the puppy, and befriended the puppy.  While 

In the morning the adepts had recovered a bit, graciously thanked us for helping them
and crafting/repairing their weapons and were about to leave until they discovered some
additional copper coins in their pockets.  Moira make a comment like "Thats what happens
you hide in the money tree" meanwhile promising to herself that she was going to hide more
copper in the tree after they left.  Beniferious saw their pitiful attepts at making a map
and decided to help them make a really decent map to get back to the tree.

Once everyone had left, we had continued on down the path on our journey.  After a of
uneventful days we ran across what appeared to be a farmer that was simply swearing up
a storm at the top of the hill.  Yeet, always weary of new people, astral projected
and noticed the townie was just a normal non-adept person.  As we approached the man, we
noticed that the wagon has a severly damaged wheel.  He asked if we could help him repair
the wagon so that he could continue on his journey to the town of "Cherry Pit".  A'Mon took
it upon himself to repair the wheel and offered to introduce us to some of the locals in
Cherry Pit.

All of us, except Yeet, were able prove that we weren't tainted.  After some cajoling from
Vic, we were able to convince the towns folk to let Yeet into the town as welli (though they
want everyone to closely watch the inept Yeet).  The townie that we were talking to let us 
know that another party had recently come through the town and were the ones responsible for 
mending relations between the two towns on their way that Barter Town.  When asked how this 
party was able to mend relations, they let us know that the party was quite persuasive and 
was able to get the towns to agree to a blood pact between them to mend relations between them.
